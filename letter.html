    <h2>To My Forever Cutie 💌</h2>
    <p>
      My Priyanshi,<br><br>
     Hey You, 🌻

So if you’ve made it this far—through this weird, cute little site—I guess you already know… this was never just about your birthday.

It’s about you.
And what you’ve meant to me.

First, a small confession:
I don’t know how to code. Like, at all.
But somehow… I built this. With broken code, late nights, a stubborn heart—and honestly, a whole lot of YouTube tutorials. 😅

Why?

Because I wanted to.
Because you’re worth every minute of it.

You’ve always been special to me.
Even now, when life has shifted and things have changed, you still hold that quiet space in me where I go when I want to feel warmth, calm, and a little less alone.

I didn’t make this to bring back the past, or ask for anything more.
This isn’t about expectations.
It’s about a feeling—a soft, honest kind of love that still lives here, quietly, without asking for much.

And maybe, if you're okay with it…
Can we continue our late-night video calls?
Nothing intense. Nothing long. Just 10 minutes.
To talk. To breathe. To be.

Not because we need anything from each other.
But just to know someone’s there.
To remind each other—maybe, or maybe not—but someone still thinks of you at 2 a.m.
No labels. No pressure. Just presence.

Let’s grow. Apart or together.
Let’s cheer for each other from near or far.
And if nothing else, let’s be that quiet assurance in the chaos—
The “I’ve got you” in a world that sometimes doesn’t.

Happy Birthday again.
Thank you for being my calm in the storm.
And thank you for letting me care for you, in my own awkward, glitchy, heartfelt way.

Always here,
Nishant <br><br>
      Happy Birthday to the most beautiful soul I know.<br><br>
      Forever yours,  
      <br>— Nishant ❤️
